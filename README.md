# simple connect 4 in python / connect four game in python

This is a simple console edition of the [connect 4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game written in python 3.

I have coded this in about 6 hours as a homework @university (computer science as a freshman).

## use

Run it with **IDLE** or call it using your **Terminal**:

	./python3 connect4.py

## notes

This is only a simple version of the game so maybe there are some bugs.

**Fixed some?** Feel free to push a request ;)
